# NeuralNetwork_Based_AutonomousCar
This project focuses on developing an autonomous car system powered by neural networks (NN). It utilizes deep learning techniques to enable key functionalities such as perception, path planning, and control. The system processes real-world sensor data to detect the environment, predict obstacles, and make driving decisions.
